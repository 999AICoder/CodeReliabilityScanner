# CodeReliabilityScanner

## Overview
CodeReliabilityScanner is a tool designed to analyze Python code repositories for potential reliability issues. It uses static code analysis and machine learning techniques to identify and assess various code patterns that might affect the reliability of your software.

## Features
- Scans Python files in a git repository
- Assesses error handling patterns
- Calculates risk based on likelihood and impact
- Annotates code with identified issues

## How to Use scanner.py

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install gitpython
   ```

2. Update the repository path in the `scanner.py` file:
   ```python
   scanner = ReliabilityScanner("/path/to/your/repo")
   ```

3. Run the scanner:
   ```
   python scanner.py
   ```

4. The scanner will analyze all Python files in the specified repository and annotate them with identified issues.

## Customization
You can extend the `ReliabilityScanner` class in `scanner.py` to add more checks or modify the risk model according to your project's needs.

## Note
This is a basic implementation and may require further development for production use.
